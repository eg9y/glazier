import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Glazier provides unstyled, fully accessible window management components for React. Build desktop-like interfaces with draggable, resizable windows—bring your own UI.

## Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Draggable Windows" icon="cursor">
		Drag windows with pointer capture for reliable tracking
	</Card>
	<Card title="Resizable" icon="resize">
		Resize from 8 directions (n, s, e, w, ne, nw, se, sw)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Snap-to-edges" icon="left-right">
		Visual preview with left/right 50% split
	</Card>
	<Card title="Window States" icon="layers">
		Maximize, minimize, restore with bounds memory
	</Card>
	<Card title="Desktop Icons" icon="grid">
		Grid snapping, drag support, and multi-select
	</Card>
	<Card title="Headless Design" icon="paintbrush">
		Zero styles included, full control over appearance
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why Glazier?

### Headless Design

Glazier provides behavior, not appearance. Components handle positioning, state management, and user interactions—you provide all styling. This gives you complete control over the look and feel.

### Component Registry Pattern

For apps with multiple window types, use the registry pattern. Define components once, then open windows by referencing their `componentId`. This makes window state fully serializable (great for localStorage or URL persistence).

```tsx
const registry = {
	settings: SettingsPanel,
	terminal: TerminalApp,
	notes: NotesApp,
};

<WindowManagerProvider registry={registry}>
	<Desktop>
		{({ Component, windowId, componentProps }) => (
			<Window id={windowId}>
				<Component windowId={windowId} {...componentProps} />
			</Window>
		)}
	</Desktop>
</WindowManagerProvider>;
```
